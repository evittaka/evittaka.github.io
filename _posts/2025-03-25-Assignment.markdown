Today we will introduce the San Francisco crime data which contains records of reported crimes in San Francisco, categorized by various attributes such as crime type, date and time, police district, and geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). The dataset typically includes information on crimes like assault, theft, vandalism, robbery, and more. This dataset is valuable for understanding crime patterns, identifying high-crime areas, and enhancing public safety efforts.

We will look deeper into vehicle theft data.
